Hello there!

I am [Onur Genes](https://onurgenes.com). I am a Software Developer with 7+ years experience, CEO of ["epist.io"](https://epist.io) and reverse engineer.

I am always trying to teach people the things I know. Because knowledge grows when shared. This is the summary of this blog.

DevGenes is kind of a pun about my surname. It's originally Gene≈ü but, in English, you have to write as Genes. Which is also plural of ["gene"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gene).

Most of the blog will be about development but I will try to share my insights about being developer and also about life. Probably you will just care about development stuff.

Onur.
